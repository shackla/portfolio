                        <h3>Project Brief</h3>
                        <p>Design a product to aid the ageing population.</p>
                    </header>
                    <p>At the beginning of this project we were given a very broad project brief , to design something
                        to aid the ageing population of Ireland. This gave us the freedom to go out and talk to our user
                        base to find out what their problems were so that we could engineer a solution for them. I got
                        us to engage with our entire stakeholder base from doctors and nurses, to the ederly and their
                        carers to find the real problems in their life that needed fixing.
                        <br>
                        The problem that we identified was reliability of mobility aid brake.,They would often wear down
                        to the point that they could no longer provide support for user and care facilities were
                        spending a lot of money throwing old mobility aids out as there was no easy way replace them.
                        .

                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                        <p>Two systems. Dynamic disc braking. Smart parking brake. </p>
                    </header>
                    <p>The dynamic braking system was based off the disc brakes found on mountain bikes. The benefits
                        were two fold, it both reduced the force required to apply the brakes dramatically and made it
                        easier to replace them.
                        <br>
                        The Smart braking system solved the slipping problem. Th milled surface of the disc would guide
                        the pin into the hole locking the wheels in position and the brake was activated by a large
                        ergonomic button with safety sensors in place to prevent accidental deployment.

                    <h3>Design Development</h3>

                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gb/P1200076.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            Mechanical design of the system began by creating a full 3D model. For purposes of the
                            prototype we were adapting the braking system of an old mobility so spacers had to be
                            manufactured to allow for the installation of the new disc brakes (retrofitted from
                            a bicycle). Most of the new parts were 3D printed apart from the parking brake components
                            which were milled out of aluminium to ensure their strength. <br>
                            Finite Element Analysis was also performed on the systems to ensure that the new parts would
                            not break under normal operating conditions.


                        </p>

                        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gb/rotation_gif.gif" alt="" /></span>
                            An Arduino was used as the controller for the parking brake system. It operated two solenoid
                            actuated pins that upon activation would engage with the wheel and stop the mobility aid. As
                            a safety precaution a motion sensor was added in the form of a hall effect sensor and magnet
                            inset into the wheel that could sense if the aid was move and stop the parks from deploying.
                            The system also used the inbuilt EEPROM to stored the last brake state so that in the case
                            of a power outaged the brake would not disengage suddenly.
                            <br>
                            Throughout the whole design process to the user and their needs were kept at the forefront
                            of out thoughts. With each change or new feature we added we tested it with our endusers,
                            ensuring that all of our choices were well informed.

                    <h3>Reflections</h3>
                    <p>This was the first truly open ended project that I had engaged with and I thoroughly enjoyed the
                        experience. It gave me my first taste of working as part of a design team and all the issues
                        that come with it such as dealing with lead time, group communication, effectively presenting
                        your work and dealing with stakeholders. <br>
                        The project was also a steep technical challenge for me as I took on developing most of the
                        project's electronics and software. A task that I found quite challenging given that I had
                        little formal training in the subject but made it more rewarding once I made something work !
