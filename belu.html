                            project brief set to us by an industry sponsor. Our sponsor, <a

                        <p>Over one ⅓ of all food produced worldwide is wasted</p>
                    </header>
                    <p>The hospitality and food services sector
                        being one of the biggest contributors. If food waste was a country it would be the largest green
                        house gas emitter in the world, after China and the USA. It’s not just the food that is being
                        wasted, it is also wasting all of the time, money, water, labour and transport costs that it
                        took to
                        get the food from a farm to your plate.</p>
                    <header>
                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                        <p>The aim was is to stop food waste at the source</p>
                    </header>
                    <p>Before it is ordered, cooked or even grown by capturing, categorizing and quantifying the food
                        waste in restaurants. This information is gathered using computer vision, and relayed this
                        information to managers through an intuitive UI allowing them to have better control over their
                        inventory, save money and subsequently reduce their impact on the environment.</p>

                            9 month
                            design cycle both the Irish and Italian teams engaged with stakeholders to develop numerous
                            prototypes. First identified key stakeholder groups and built empathy maps and personas.
                            This allowed us to better understand our problem space and single out particular points of
                            friction that our users have when dealing with said problem.</br>
                            We then built prototypes to test critical functions with our users and used their feedback
                            and experiences to refine our design. This input from the users coupled with technical
                            research and benchmarking reviews of existing technologies and patents allowed us to
                            converge on a solution to the problem that fit our end users'needs. Our first prototype had
                            the functionailty to both provide buisnesses with useful data and the means to convey that
                            data in a meaningful way. The physical unit was also designed to be as easy to use as
                            possible through ergonomic mechanical design and automation. </p>

                            design
                            cycle
                            began after receiving funding from the Launchbox Student Accelerator Program. This marked a
                            shift in our design focus as now we not only had to think about how to fit our product to
                            our users needs but we also had to make the idea financially viable. During this time we
                            pitched to multiple investors and startup funds and focussed on honing our value proposition
                            for our product. Coming from a Engineering background this was an eye opening experience and
                            we quickly had to learn to balance the commercial side of things with our need to drive the
                            technical development of our product forward.

                            During our time in LaunchBox and after we refined our prototype design, developed an
                            adaptable pitch deck while working on our business plan and developing a logo. The product
                            was showcased at <a

                    <p>This project was a great test of both my technical and project maangaemtn skills. It gave me experience working in fast paced, deadline driven design cycles as well as working as part of a multi-disciplinary, international team.
